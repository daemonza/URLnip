URLnip
------

NOTE : Still heavily in development, lots still to do
But here is the basic idea

sho.rt is just a example domain :)

Shorten's a given URL to the configured ENV var domain  + 4 characters

Example shortend url : http://sho.rt/3a07

Usage
-----

Go to http://sho.rt/shorten/URL you want to shorten
and get something like this back :
http://sho.rt/3a07

Configure a domain enviroument varible to your domain and start URLnip through
whichever Rack server you prefer. I recommend Passenger with Nginx (http://www.modrails.com/)
